From SUBJ: MATLAB code for RSat, 05DEC21


Downloading the pertinent toolboxes:

Download ‘git’ for Windows
From CMD, do the following:
git clone https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab rtb


git clone https://github.com/petercorke/spatial-math smtb


git clone https://github.com/petercorke/toolbox-common-matlab common

(Followed from here: https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/)

Import toolboxes in MATLAB
(This is already in my code, but you’ll need to change the directory MATLAB looks in)
>> addpath rtb common smtb

NSTAR_ArmSim_script_Corke_rev3.m
This is sort of a ‘sandbox’, with descriptions of the code that I used
Has the RSat robot w non-spherical wrist D-H
Started a part of the code to put functional bounds on motor angles (so arm doesn’t break)
RSat_NASAdemo_DEC21_rev0.m
This is a draft of the code for the demo (Riley, there are commented instructions for finishing it near the top)
